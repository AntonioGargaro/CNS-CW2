\section{Self-Signed X.509 Certificate}

The creation of a self-signed X.509 was relatively straightforward based off of the commands provided by the course. Below is a list of steps performed, and evidence captured, of our X.509 certificate.

\noindent We first created our certificate based on Jason's details seen in figure \ref{fig:x509_creation:jason}.

\noindent We then exported the certificate into a \textbf{*.cer} file by the alias name seen in figure \ref{fig:x509_creation:cert_exp}.

\noindent Viewing the details of the file confirms we have completed this section, as the X.509 file is owned and issued by Jason, displaying a self-signed certificate as seen in figure \ref{fig:x509_creation:cert_exp}.
