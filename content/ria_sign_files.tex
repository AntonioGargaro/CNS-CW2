\section{RIA File Signatures \& Verification With PGP Keys}

This section discusses how the file signing and verification process works. We used the BouncyCastle package which uses a PGP private key and the file requiring signed, followed by the public key for verification. Below is the order of operations,

\subsection{Sign}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A file, private key and passphrase are passed into the Sign()
    \item Adds BouncyCastle to security provider
    \item Input files are read in
    \item Private key ring is iterated over to obtain private key
    \item File is signed with private key
    \item Signed file is outputted to input file directory
    \item Displayed on RIA
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Verify}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The file, the signed file and public key and is into the Verify()
    \item Adds BouncyCastle to security provider
    \item Input files are read in
    \item Public key ring is iterated over to obtain public key
    \item Signed file is verified with public key
    \item Boolean is returned
    \item Displayed on RIA
\end{enumerate}
